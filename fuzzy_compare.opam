synopsis: "Fastest bounded Levenshtein comparator over generic structures"
description: """
This library does not calculate the edit distance.

Rather, it provides extremely efficient automata that answer whether 2 values are within a predetermined number of edits of one another. Edits are: additions, deletions, replacements.

Once generated, an automaton can be reused to compare any 2 values in around 2-8 Âµs.
